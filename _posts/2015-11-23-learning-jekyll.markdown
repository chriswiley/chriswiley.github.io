# A New World
Now that I have heard about __Jekyll__ I was wondering if I'd like to make my blog using it.
I like the idea of not using a database and just using text. And the idea of a static site is great because of the speed increase you get when you don't have to make any calls.

I must say I am happy with how easy it is to install. Now I have to see how well I like the syncing side to my server. I am going to first try and use github pages and then I will do it on my own server. I am also new to __Markdown__ and would like to see how it is used and how fast it will make my copy writing go.

All I can tell is that this is very fun to __learn__ and to **see** *see* _see_

I hope it is very easy to understand.
